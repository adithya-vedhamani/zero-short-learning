# zero-short-learning
Zero-shot learning is when we are testing a model on a task for which it hasn't been trained.  In Zero-shot classification we are asking the model to do classification for labels which model hasn't seen during the model.
Using the NLI method we can propose a sentence to be classified as a Premise and can construct a hypothesis for each classification label?

E.g Let's say we have the sentence “one day I will see the world” and we would like to classify whether this sentence is about

travel,

cooking,

dancing

Now for all three classification labels, we can have three hypothesis

Hypothesis 1: This text is about travel

Hypothesis 2: This text is about cooking

Hypothesis 3: This text is about dancing
